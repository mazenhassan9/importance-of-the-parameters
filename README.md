# Importance-of-the-parameters
1) The Goal was to create a Machine learning Random Forest Algorithm Regerisor. 2) I've cleaned the data from null, missing and categorical values, made it more applicable for the model. 3) choosing the model and hyper tuning it, 4) testing the importance of the parameters, then dropping the useless parameters in order to make the model more efficient. 5) The model achieved 93.3% accuracy with all parameters while achieving 93.2% after dropping all the useless and impacted a huge improvement in performance.
